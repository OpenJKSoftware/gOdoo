# This is the default repospec.yml
# Here we can specify which Version of odoo to Clone and which Thirdparty libraries we want to clone from git.
# a "Repo" always consists of an "url" and "branch" or "commit". where "commit" can basicallly be every valid Git ref.
# When only selecting "branch" and no "commit" this causes wodoo to always pull changes form the remote.
# On big repos like Odoo this can be really slow.
# Specifying a more specific ref in the "commit" section, we can pin the Version.
# This also causes wodoo get-source to skip over already matching Repos. (Big speed bump on launches.)

# When `--source-download-archive` or it's envvar is passed to wodoo, Downloads will be even faster for big repos, because Zip Blobs will directly be downloaded.

# The Odoo section describes where to Clone the odoo source code form. (the one with odoo-bin)
