# This is the default manifest.yml
# Here we can specify which Version of odoo to Clone and which Thirdparty libraries we want to clone from git.
# a "Repo" always consists of an "url" and "branch" or "commit". where "commit" can basicallly be every valid Git ref.
# When only selecting "branch" and no "commit" this causes godoo to always pull changes form the remote.
# On big repos like Odoo this can be really slow.
# Specifying a more specific ref in the "commit" section, we can pin the Version.
# This also causes `godoo source get` to skip over already matching Repos. (Big speed bump on launches.)

# When `--source-download-archive` or it's envvar is passed to godoo, Downloads will be even faster for big repos, because Zip Blobs will directly be downloaded.

odoo:
  # The Odoo section describes where to Clone the odoo source code form. (the one with odoo-bin)
  url: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/
  branch: 16.0 # Branch is mandatory on Odoo Repo but not on OCA Repos
thirdparty:
  # In the thirdparty section we can add more Repos to download.
  # This can also be an ssh style Url for Odoo Enterprise for example.
  OCA: # This repo folder will be called "OCA_server-tools" when downloading.
    - url: https://github.com/OCA/server-tools
      branch: 16.0
